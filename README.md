🚀 Project Overview

LinkMeUp is a mobile-first social connection app that allows users to share all their social media profiles using one QR code or one link.

This project is built intentionally using:

Clean Architecture

Riverpod for state management

Firebase for backend & auth

⚠️ This repo is not just about shipping fast.
It is about learning industry-standard product engineering.

🎯 Core Product Principle (VERY IMPORTANT)

One core action:
“Show my QR so someone can scan and connect with me.”

Every screen, feature, and line of code must support this.

If it doesn’t → we don’t build it (yet).

🧠 Why This Architecture?
Why Clean Architecture?

Because:

UI changes often

Business rules should not

Firebase should be replaceable later

Testing becomes possible

Scaling becomes easier

Clean Architecture helps you think like a senior engineer, not just write code.
